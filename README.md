# Assignment Instructions
Often, when learning or practicing an analysis technique, it is helpful to generate data, rather than collecting it. Generated (i.e., synthetic) data can be defined with certain characteristics and relationships among variables that would test specific aspects of a multiple regression model prior to testing the model on real data. In addition, it is essential to know how to use this data to perform a linear regression analysis on par with expected scientific standards, as well as how to visualize and interpret those results.

For this activity, perform the following:

1. Read "A Cognitive Vulnerability Model of Sleep and Mood in Adolescents under Naturalistically Restricted and Extended Sleep Opportunities," located in the topic Resources.
Familiarize yourself with the objectives of the study, the methodology, and approach to data analysis. Note: The study attempted to assess how many minutes it takes to fall asleep (SOLacti) and higher scores on subjective sleep quality indicate poorer sleep quality.
2. Then, refer to the "DSC-520 Multiple Linear Regression Analysis Guide" for additional instructions. Although the guide will provide you with hints on which functions to use, you must locate and read the user manual for each one of these functions for syntax and available parameters.
3. Then, submit a professionally written and formatted software-based technical report. Make sure the documentation contains the code, relevant plots, your analysis and the appropriate citations and references.

While APA style is not required for the body of this assignment, solid academic writing is expected, and documentation of sources should be presented using APA formatting guidelines, which can be found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center.

This assignment uses a rubric. Review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.

You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.
