### Task 2
Create a synthetic dataset using the code provided in the "DSC-520 Multiple Regression –
Dataset." Note that this snippet of R code is designed to generate data that approximates the 
data described in the article.

```{r}
# Generate synthetic dataset
library(data.table)
set.seed(12345)
adosleep <- data.table(
 SOLacti = rnorm(150, 4.4, 1.3)^2,
 DBAS = rnorm(150, 72, 26),
 DAS = rnorm(150, 125, 32),
 Female = rbinom(150, 1, .53),
 Stress = rnorm(150, 32, 11))
adosleep[, SSQ := rnorm(150,
 (.36*3/12.5)*SOLacti +
 (.16*3/26)*DBAS +
 (.18*3/.5)*Female +
 (.20*3/11)*Stress,2.6)]
adosleep[, MOOD := rnorm(150,
 (-.07/12.5)*SOLacti +
 (.29/3)*SSQ +
 (.14/26)*DBAS +
 (.21/32)*DAS +
 (.12/32)*SSQ*(DAS-50) +
 (.44/.5)*Female +
 (.28/11)*Stress, 2)]
adosleep[, Female := factor(Female, levels=0:1, labels = c("Males", "Females"
))]
# Display the synthetic dataset
adosleep
```

### Task 3
Instructions: Inspect the core variables to assess their distribution (using the testdistr function) and 
identify outliers: MOOD, SSQ, SOLacti, DAS. Plot the distribution of each variable.

Now that we have our data, we will inspect the distributions and identify outliers for the following variables: `SOLacti`, `DAS`, `SSQ`, and `MOOD`. 

#### Variable `SOLacti`
```{r}
# Assess the distribution of 'SOLacti' 
dist <- testDistribution(adosleep$SOLacti)
type <- dist$distr
paste("Distribution type:", type)
```
We see from the `$distr` variable that the distribution of `SOLacti` is roughly normal. 

```{r}
# Identify outliers of 'SOLacti'
Q1 <- quantile(adosleep$SOLacti, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(adosleep$SOLacti, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
outliers <- which(adosleep$SOLacti < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | adosleep$SOLacti > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))
outliers <- adosleep[outliers, ]
head(outliers)
```
```{r}
# Plot distribution of 'SOLacti'
hist(adosleep$SOLacti, main = "Histogram of SOLacti", xlab = "SOLacti", col = "skyblue", border = "black")
```

#### Variable `DAS`
```{r}
# Assess the distribution of 'DAS' 
dist <- testDistribution(adosleep$DAS)
type <- dist$distr
paste("Distribution type:", type)
```
Just as with the previous variable, `DAS` is normally distributed. 

```{r}
# Identify outliers of 'DAS'
Q1 <- quantile(adosleep$DAS, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(adosleep$DAS, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
outliers <- which(adosleep$DAS < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | adosleep$DAS > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))
outliers <- adosleep[outliers, ]
head(outliers)
```
```{r}
# Plot distribution of 'DAS'
hist(adosleep$DAS, main = "Histogram of DAS", xlab = "DAS", col = "red", border = "black")
```

#### Variable `SSQ`
```{r}
# Assess the distribution of 'SSQ' 
dist <- testDistribution(adosleep$SSQ)
type <- dist$distr
paste("Distribution type:", type)
```
`SSQ` also follows a roughly normal distribution. 

```{r}
# Identify outliers of 'SSQ'
Q1 <- quantile(adosleep$SSQ, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(adosleep$SSQ, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
outliers <- which(adosleep$SSQ < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | adosleep$SSQ > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))
outliers <- adosleep[outliers, ]
head(outliers)
```
```{r}
# Plot distribution of 'SSQ'
hist(adosleep$SOLacti, main = "Histogram of SSQ", xlab = "SSQ", col = "forestgreen", border = "black")
```

#### Variable `MOOD`
```{r}
# Assess the distribution of 'MOOD' 
dist <- testDistribution(adosleep$MOOD)
type <- dist$distr
paste("Distribution type:", type)
```
`MOOD` is also normally distributed. 

```{r}
# Identify outliers of 'MOOD'
Q1 <- quantile(adosleep$MOOD, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(adosleep$MOOD, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
outliers <- which(adosleep$MOOD < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) | adosleep$MOOD > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))
outliers <- adosleep[outliers, ]
head(outliers)
```
```{r}
# Plot distribution of 'MOOD'
hist(adosleep$SOLacti, main = "Histogram of MOOD", xlab = "MOOD", col = "orange", border = "black")
```

### Task 4
Instructions: Examine the bivariate correlations between study variables: SSQ, MOOD, Stress, SOLacti, 
DAS, DBAS. Plot a heatmap depicting the correlations table (use the plot function and 
appropriate theme).

Next, we will examine the correlations between the study variables `SOLacti`, `DBAS`, `DAS`, `Stress`, `SSQ`, and `MOOD`. This can be done using a heatmap. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Get subset of data containing only necessary variables
study_variables <- adosleep[, c("SOLacti", "DBAS", "DAS", "Stress", "SSQ", "MOOD")]

# Generate correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(study_variables)
corr_matrix <- round(corr_matrix, digits=2)
corr_matrix <- round(corr_matrix, digits=3)
print(corr_matrix)

# Generate heatmap
heatmap.2(corr_matrix, main="Bivariate Correlations Heatmap", col=colorRampPalette(c("blue","white","red"))(100), margins=c(5,5), notecol="black", Rowv=NULL, Colv=NULL, symkey=FALSE, key=TRUE)
```
We see that the strongest correlations occur between `MOOD` and `DAS`, `MOOD` and `SSQ`, `MOOD` and `Stress`, and `SSQ` and `Stress`. 

### Task 5
Create a basic table of graphs of descriptive statistics using the egltable function. Standardize 
the predictors to get standardized estimates (as in the article) using 
`as.vector(scale(variable_name))`.

<b>Predictors:</b> `SOLacti`, `DBAS`, `DAS`, `Stress`. 

```{r}
# Display descriptive statistics
egltable(data = adosleep, 
         vars = c("SOLacti", "DBAS", "DAS", "Stress", "SSQ", "MOOD")
)
```
```{r}
# Standardize predictors
standardized_adosleep <- adosleep
standardized_adosleep$SOLacti <- as.vector(scale(standardized_adosleep$SOLacti))
standardized_adosleep$DBAS <- as.vector(scale(standardized_adosleep$DBAS))
standardized_adosleep$DAS <- as.vector(scale(standardized_adosleep$DAS))
standardized_adosleep$Stress <- as.vector(scale(standardized_adosleep$SOLacti))

# Display descriptive statistics of standardized predictors to confirm successful standardization
egltable(data = standardized_adosleep, 
         vars = c("SOLacti", "DBAS", "DAS", "Stress")
)
```

### Task 6
Fit three different models and compare them. 
* Model 1: Just the covariates
* Model 2: Model 1 + main constructs of interest without interactions
* Model 3: Model 2 + add the hypothesized interaction between subjective sleep quality and global dysfunctional beliefs

```{r}
# Fit model 1 (covariates only)
model1 <- lm(MOOD ~ SOLacti + DBAS + Female + Stress, data = standardized_adosleep)

# Fit model 2 (main construct of interest DAS added)
model2 <- lm(MOOD ~ DAS + SOLacti + DBAS + Female + Stress, data = standardized_adosleep)

# Fit model 3 (interaction term between SSQ and DAS added)
model3 <- lm(MOOD ~ DAS + SOLacti + DBAS + Female + Stress + SSQ:DAS, data = standardized_adosleep)
```

### Task 7
Combine the results of the three models into one table using the screenreg() function. Note 
the asterisk to the right of the threshold p-values and the errors in parentheses.

<b>Note:</b> Attempting to install the `screenreg` package led to this warning: 
`Warning in install.packages :
  package ‘screenreg’ is not available for this version of R`
  
Thus, I opted to use a package with similar functionality, `stargazer`. 

```{r}
# Display regression results side-by-side
thresholds <- c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001)
regression_results <- stargazer(model1, model2, model3, type="text", p.auto = FALSE, p.thresholds = thresholds)
```


### Task 8
Since higher scores on subjective sleep quality indicate poorer sleep quality, assess which 
model (if any) shows that overall worse sleep quality and overall dysfunctional attitudes are 
significantly associated with more negative mood (p < .001).

IE: Which model (if any) shows that `SOLacti` and `DBAS` are significantly associated with `MOOD`? 

We see from the results that `SOLActi` is significantly associated with `MOOD` in all 3 models (P < 0.001), but `DBAS` does not cross the P < 0.001 threshold in any of the models. 

### Task 9
Ensure that the models are appropriate. Check the variance inflation factors (using the vif
function) and the distribution of residuals (using the testdistr function). Describe and 
interpret your findings.

```{r}
# Check for aliased coefficients in model 1
print(alias(model1))
```
```{r}
# Check for aliased coefficients in model 2
print(alias(model2))
```

```{r}
# Check for aliased coefficients in model 3
print(alias(model3))
```

It appears that `SOLacti` has an aliased coefficient in all 3 models, thus preventing VIF calculation, so we will remove it and check VIF. 

```{r}
# Refit models without 'SOLacti'
model1_noalias <- lm(MOOD ~ DBAS + Female + Stress, data = standardized_adosleep)
model2_noalias <- lm(MOOD ~ DAS + DBAS + Female + Stress, data = standardized_adosleep)
model3_noalias <- lm(MOOD ~ DAS + DBAS + Female + Stress + SSQ:DAS, data = standardized_adosleep)
```

```{r}
# Check model 1 VIF
print(car::vif(model1_noalias))
```

The VIF values for all 3 predictors are very close to 1, indicating no strong correlation with other predictors. 

```{r}
# Check model 1 residual distribution
dist <- testDistribution(residuals(model1))
type <- dist$distr
paste("Residual distribution type:", type)
```

The residuals for model 1 are normally distributed, so this assumption of linear regression is not violated. 

```{r}
# Check model 2 VIF
print(car::vif(model2_noalias))
```

As in the last model, all predictors have VIFs close to 1, indicating no multicollinearity. 

```{r}
# Check model 2 residual distribution
dist <- testDistribution(residuals(model2))
type <- dist$distr
paste("Residual distribution type:", type)
```

```{r}
# Check model 3 VIF
print(car::vif(model3_noalias))
```

In model 3, we see that `DAS` and `DAS:SSQ` have high VIFs, though this is because the latter involves the former, so we would expect this. Thus, there are no unexpected problems. 

```{r}
# Check model 3 residual distribution
dist <- testDistribution(residuals(model3))
type <- dist$distr
paste("Residual distribution type:", type)
```

All 3 models have normally-distributed residuals, meaning they are likely to be appropriate. Further tests for homoscedasticity and independence of residuals would further bolster the credibility of the models. 

### Task 10
Refit the model on raw (i.e., nonstandardized data).

```{r}
# Refit model 3 on nonstandardized data
model3 <- lm(MOOD ~ DAS + SOLacti + DBAS + Female + Stress + SSQ:DAS, data = adosleep)
summary(model3)
```

### Task 11
Use ggplot to visualize the relations between subjective sleep quality and negative mood, and 
the relation of poor sleep quality and mood of vulnerable adolescents with higher levels of 
dysfunctional attitudes. If you completed the previous steps correctly, the following R code 
should plot the graph:

```{r}
# Plot SSQ vs. MOOD with DAS color
ggplot(adosleep, aes(x = SSQ, y = MOOD, color=DAS)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Subjective Sleep Quality (SSQ)",
    y = "Negative Mood (MOOD)",
    title = "Subjective Sleep Quality vs. Negative Mood by DAS"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
<br><br>
We see a fairly strong positive linear relationship between subjective sleep quality and negative mood, so it is safe to say that this data indicates that an individual who reports a higher subjective sleep quality will be more likely to suffer from low mood. Additionally, we see that lighter-colored points are more common at higher negative mood levels, indicating that `DAS` has a noticeable effect on an individual's negative mood. 

### Task 12
Review the original objective of the analysis and ensure you were able to address the objectives, produce answers, and back up your claims with relevant calculations.

<b>Study objectives: </b>School terms and vacations represent naturally occurring periods of restricted and extended sleep opportunities. <span style="color:red">A cognitive model of the relationships among objective sleep, subjective sleep, and negative mood was tested across these periods, with sleep-specific (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep) and global (i.e., dysfunctional attitudes) cognitive vulnerabilities as moderators.</span>
<br><br>
<b>Objective checklist:</b>

* Modeled relationships between objective sleep, subjective sleep, and negative mood? ✔
* Included dysfunctional attitudes and cognitive vulnerabilities in the analysis? ✔

<br>

All study objectives have been addressed, and all claims have been backed up with calculations and visualizations.
